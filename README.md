BlankUp wrapped in Electron. Markdown Editor with clarity +1

Extremely incomplete version.
Also clone will probably be broken right now, as BlankUp which is its own package has some unpublished changes that are needed to make this run.

Look for something working at the End of July.

Need to implement all the nice things:

- [x] Create new, empty file
	- [x] Focus new file on creation
	- [x] Click under editor focuses it
- [x] Save new file using system dialog
- [x] Open files
- [x] Feedback when users close edited files
- [x] Error handle all the things
- [x] Shortcuts to move between open files
- [ ] Detect closing of window and check for unsaved changes
- [ ] Fix a bug that lets editors think they have changed when a new file gets added
- [ ] Enable preview

And then all the bugs and errors.
